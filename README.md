Not quite done, lots of things missin (eg: db not connected to front, cors permissions problems and the posts section is not finished yet).

Clarification for the tables: I created all of them "mannualy" using pgAdmin4 because of some distincts ways there are to create tables with this new versions, so to test the back with postam or with the localhost:3001 using the default views, you'll have to do it too.

run npm i in both folders
